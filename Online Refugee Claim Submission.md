# Asylum Interoperability Project

## Online Refugee Claim Submission

### Background

Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) both process refugee claims and make eligibility determination. Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) also makes a determination on the basis of claim.

The work is divided into CBSA processing refugee claims made the Port of Entry (PoE) and IRCC and CBSA processing inland refugee claims.

### Process Barriers

Current inland refugee claims are done through claimants filling out multiple forms and sending it to IRCC and CBSA (with IRB playing some role) for processing. This process is labor intensive and time consuming. The form itself is long and confusing as to what information is required.

Current list of forms used are:

- Document Checklist ([IMM 5745](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5745e.pdf))
- Generic Application Form for Canada ([IMM 0008](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm0008enu_2d.pdf))
- Additional Dependents / Declaration ([IMM 0008DEP](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm0008depenu.pdf)), if you have more dependents than can be listed on the Generic Application Form for Canada
- Schedule A – Background / Declaration ([IMM 5669](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5669e.pdf))
- Schedule 12 – Refugee Claimants Inside Canada ([IMM 0008 – Schedule 12](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm0008_12e.pdf))
- Use of a Representative ([IMM 5476](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5476e.pdf)), if applicable
- [Appointment of a Designated Representative for Accompanied Minors](https://irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/forms/Pages/designated-representative-minors.aspx) (IRB)
