## Online Refugee Claim Submission

### Background

Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) both process refugee claims and make eligibility determination. Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) also makes a determination on the basis of claim.

The work is divided into CBSA processing refugee claims made the Port of Entry (PoE) and IRCC and CBSA processing inland refugee claims.

### Problems

Current inland refugee claims are done through claimants filling out multiple forms and sending it to IRCC for processing. This is labour intensive and time consuming. The form itself is long and confusing as to what information is required.

List of forms currently needed are:

- Generic Application Form for Canada (IMM 0008)
- Additional Dependents / Declaration (IMM 0008DEP), if you have more dependents than can be listed on the Generic Application Form for Canada
- Schedule A – Background / Declaration (IMM 5669)
- Schedule 12 – Refugee Claimants Inside Canada (IMM 0008 – Schedule 12)
- Document Checklist (IMM 5745)
- Use of a Representative (IMM 5476), if applicable
- Basis of Claim Form (IRB)

### Requirements

> Digitalize and streamline the refugee claim process to allow claimants or their authorized representatives to submit claims online and/or submit subsequent information after claim is made.
